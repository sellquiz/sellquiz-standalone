# SELL Quiz - Standalone Examples

This repository demonstrates the embedding of SELL-quizzes into websites.

(We will also release plugins for Moodle and Ilias. As soon as these tools are available, we will put a link here).

If you are interested in using the low-level API (for example to embed SELL into an E-Learning Management System), please refer to the main SELL repository: https://github.com/sellquiz/sellquiz
